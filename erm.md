Subject: Backend Engineer Application

Hi!
I'm Alen, and I'm excited about the Backend Engineer role at Confident AI. 

I'm currently a Software Engineer II at Mercor ($10B talent marketplace), where I work PST hours from India collaborating with the SF team. I've been building scalable systems with Python, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and AWS for the past couple years, including work on LLM fine tuning and AI platforms.

What draws me to Confident AI is DeepEval's open-source approach and the chance to work on infrastructure that helps companies evaluate AI systems properly. I've been maintaining OSS projects for years, so this really resonates with me.

I'm ready for the 6-day/week startup intensity and excited to work directly with founders. Happy to discuss more!
